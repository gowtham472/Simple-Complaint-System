# Complaint Management System

This is a simple command-line application for managing customer complaints using SQLite as the database. The application allows users to register new complaints and update the status of existing complaints.

## Features

- **Register a New Complaint**: Users can enter their name and complaint, which will be stored in the database with a unique ID.
- **Update Complaint Status**: Users can update the status of their complaints to "RESOLVED" by providing their name and complaint ID.
